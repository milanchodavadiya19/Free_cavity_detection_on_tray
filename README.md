# object_detection_on_tray
identify the free cavity on the tray 

The project involved processing high-dimensional sensory data for predictive analytics and uses a microservice for the loading robot using Docker containers, zeroMQ and deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started


System contains 4 python files, 1 trained model file and 2 folders. 
I have used Deep Neural Networks, Docker containers, zeroMQ.

### Prerequisites
```
Keras
Docker
zeroMQ

```

### Installing
I have already trained the model so you can direcly use it.
```
mymodel.h5
```
You can also train you own network by running "train_network.py"
to train you own network you have to add images to images/notes and images/not_notes (There were many of my personal images so I did not upload it)
```
run: train_network.py
```
Testing the network. Add testing images to "examples/" and to run test.py give command line argument like below:
```
python test_network.py --image examples/image_name.jpg
```
To Delete the image from the desired folder change the path from delete_images.py and directly run the file
```
python delete_images.py
```
